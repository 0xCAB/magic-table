=Example - Table as a scatterplot=

It is also possible to render data that would normally lend themselves to a scatterplot. The table's reduced representation can, in fact, produce a view very similar to a scatterplot. Clusters and outliers in the data standout clearly. 

When you move the mouse over the surface of the table, the X-Y coordinates are displayed on the axes. Values at points near the focus are also rendered.
